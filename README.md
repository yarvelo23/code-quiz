# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive application consisting of a coding assessment containing multiple choice questions and challenges.  The application features a timed component that penalizes students for incorrect answers. At the end of the quiz, users are prompted to enter their initials and record their score. The application features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the underlying Javascript code. The application is also responsive, adapting to multiple screen sizes as needed.  

The application can be accessed directly at the following link:
